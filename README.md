# toreroshell
For this project I implemented a Linux shell program named TTSH (short for Tiny Torero Shell). TTSH supports the following:

Executing simple commands run in the foreground (e.g. ls -l)
Executing simple commands run in the background (e.g. ./siesta &)
Exiting the shell with the built-in exit command.
Displaying a list of recently executed commands using the built-in history command. history will print out the N most recently entered command lines by the user (and each oneâ€™s command ID).
